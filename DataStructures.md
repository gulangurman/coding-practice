## Data Structures

1. Array

	Fixed size.
	Fixed type.
	Might be sparse and waste memory
	Cheap access O(1)
	Add/remove is expensive O(n)

2. Linked List

	Each node has a value and a ref to another node.
	Cheap add/remove O(1)
	Access is expensive O(n)
	No index-based access. 
	Search is expensive O(n)
	Doubly linked list has two refs.

3. Map / Dictionary

	Has key-value pairs
	Commonly used to improve efficiency of algorithms (to eliminate the inner for loop)
	Add/remove is cheap O(1)
	Search is cheap O(1)
	Uses a hash function which groups elements in separate linked lists	

4. Stack

5. Queue

6. Tree

7. Heap

8. Graph
