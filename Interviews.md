## How to solve any interview problem

1. Make sure that you understand the problem completely. 
Approach the interviewer as if you're listening to a customer telling you his requirements for a software product that you'll build.
Ask questions to make sure you've covered all aspects that are unclear to you.
Try to see the picture in his mind as he provides detailed information.

2. Come up with example input/output pairs. Explain what you've understood so far to get confirmation that you're on the right track.

3. Start with the first, simplest idea that comes to your mind. Explain the algorithm steps in simple terms while writing down in pseudocode. All the while keep interacting with the listeners, showing them your thought process. Help them to get to know you in professional terms. That's the whole point of this meeting.
Show them how you approach a problem and proceed to completion when you're doing a professional task.

4. Keep in mind that they don't have much time for all this. So start simple and think about improvements later on. Don't wander off thinking about the best way to solve the problem.

5. Make improvements. Re-read the problem statement. You might've missed an important clue or a detail. Come up with various sample data. Think about joining algorithm steps, using additional memory, pre-processing the input data, using a different data structure, etc to improve the efficiency of your solution.

6. Re-read your solution. Make sure that your return type is correct, array indices don't go out of bounds, you're not dividing by zero, there are no infinite loops. 
Provide some simple, complex and invalid input data to see if they break things.


## Interview Tips: Before the interview

* Always prepare before an interview
* Solve enough problems (remember cs theory)
* Read the company's previous interview questions and reviews, try to understand the characteristics
* Read about the interview process at that company (what are the sessions, what is being questioned at each session, interview disguised as a lunch break, etc)
* Apart from ds & algo, practice Software design, System design, especially if you're experienced
* Prepare answers to behavioral questions beforehand (practice using the STAR approach, go over your cv)
* Do not apply to any company (startup vs enterprise, local vs global, us vs europe, etc). Find what you need and apply to the companies that meet your needs (set your motivation right)
* Do a research on the company. What they do, what are the products, what is the sector/domain, work culture, working environment. Ask friends of friends who work there. Look up the company website. Dress according to the company culture, or you might look like you didn't do your homework.
* Look up the requirements for the job role. Know what position you'll be interviewed for. Make sure your qualifications match.


## Interview Tips: During the interview

* Be on time, if you can't let them know early on
* Do not interrupt the interviewer, let them talk
* Avoid obvious self-advertising (i'm a good dev, i'm a good team player, etc.)  there is no point in saying those. Instead, provide solid evidence from your background to behavioral questions.
* No negative words on cuurent or previous employer or colleagues. Be professional and objective.
* Understand the question pattern (there are a few) before trying to solve it
* Ask questions if you're stuck. Do not cut off the communication. The interviewer wants to see how you get more information from outside to solve a problem when you're stuck
* Do not keep calling back to ask whether you're accepted or not. The process might take some time. Call after 2-3 weeks if you've not heard from them.


## Online Interview Tips

* Assume the same rules as an on-site interview
* Have paper and pen ready to take notes
* Adjust lighting beforehand
* Make sure the room is quiet. let your family know that you need them to be quiet during the interview
* Have a glass of water nearby
* Configure the software, headphone, cam, mic (zoom, google meet, skype, ms teams) beforehand. make a test
* Set up necessary online IDE, UML tool, etc and learn how to use them
* Learn how to use the coding tools before the interview (hackerrank's CodePair, Draw.io, etc)
* Keep internet bandwith usage to a minimum. No streaming
* Keep phone and computer notifications off
* Keep eye contact with the interviewer. Communicate as if you were face to face
* If you couldn't hear something the interviewer said, ask him/her to repeat it. 
* Keep an eye on the clock. Time is important
* Rest between sessions. Don't review previous session
* Don't try to google something. dont ask if you can
* If your voice is not going through, let your interviewer know via the chatbox that you're working on it
* If your internet connection is bad, consider switching to 4G or suggest the interviewer that you turn down video, or switch to your phone completely
* If you lose connection or audio, don't panic. reconnect immediately. if that fails call your interviewer to let them know, maybe suggest rescheduling the interview
* If there is a disturbance (a noise from outside, etc), ask the interviewer for a break to handle the situation and go stop that noise
