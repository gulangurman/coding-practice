## How to solve any interview problem

1. Make sure that you understand the problem completely. 
Approach the interviewer as if you're listening to a customer telling you his requirements for a software product that you'll build.
Ask questions to make sure you've covered all aspects that are unclear to you.
Try to see the picture in his mind as he provides detailed information.

2. Come up with example input/output pairs. Explain what you've understood so far to get confirmation that you're on the right track.

3. Start with the first, simplest idea that comes to your mind. Explain the algorithm steps in simple terms while writing down in pseudocode. All the while keep interacting with the listeners, showing them your thought process. Help them to get to know you in professional terms. That's the whole point of this meeting.
Show them how you approach a problem and proceed to completion when you're doing a professional task.

4. Keep in mind that they don't have much time for all this. So start simple and think about improvements later on. Don't wander off thinking about the best way to solve the problem.

5. Make improvements. Re-read the problem statement. You might've missed an important clue or a detail. Come up with various sample data. Think about joining algorithm steps, using additional memory, pre-processing the input data, using a different data structure, etc to improve the efficiency of your solution.

6. Re-read your solution. Make sure that your return type is correct, array indices don't go out of bounds, you're not dividing by zero, there are no infinite loops. 
Provide some simple, complex and invalid input data to see if they break things.
